SBIN DIESEL Short install guide
======================================
After deployment distributon from archive or .git repo take a look on file cmd_init.php.
It's kernel install script. Berfore execute this file you should go through some steps.

*1 Create empty MySQL database.
*2 Create DB user or take already existed.
*3 Grant him all privileges on new database
*4 copy files listed below to 'etc' folder located on the root of the  distrubution three.

 kernel/etc/conf/cache.cfg.php
 kernel/etc/conf/db.cfg.php
 kernel/etc/conf/instance.cfg.php
 kernel/etc/conf/site.cfg.php
 kernel/etc/conf/theme.cfg.php

*5 Next you should edit  files copied to 'etc/' folder. Let's see how it can be done.

  First you should edit db.cfg.php. 
  You must enter:
	  database user
	  database password
	  database name
 For details see into the db.cfg.php

 Next you should check for instances installed.
 Because no instances shipped with kernel by default, you can safely skip this step :). 
 For instance deployment instructions refer to instance manual.
 And that is all about config.

*6 So, we have configured database and ready db config file.
   And now you can just execute cmd_init.php on the root of distribution.
   This script will load tables and defaut data to database which you've pointed in db.cfg.php

*7 Now you can find admin panel at http://yoursite/xxx path. 

	Global user login cridentials:
	user: admin
	password: admin

After login you will see Applications Administration and Helper menu points.
Most of the interfaces will be intuitively understandable. 
So no more istructions. Go and get some.

!!!!DO NOT FORGET TO REMOVE cmd_init.php and cmd_dump.php. 
It's potentially dangerous for your data.
